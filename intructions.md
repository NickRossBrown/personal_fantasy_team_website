 ####It's time to scramble and start building out a portfolio site using Rails!

Note: If you are building your portfolio site using another framework or library such as Angular, you may do an alternate site, provided you've let your teacher know your proposal.

##Requirements
This is an open-ended project. What exactly does that mean? It's up to you to decide how you want to build out your Rails portfolio site. There are only five requirements:

# You should complete the "big picture" exercise before you start coding.

# The project should use Rails.

#The project should have an authentication scheme. (As the admin, you'll want to be able to easily make updates to it!)

#Your project should have a thorough commit history. For this project, you should commit at least every half hour, even if you've made minimal progress since your previous commit. If you're in the process of exploring a new tool, add a brief summary to your README about your exploration and commit.

#Your README should document the features you added to your project and any documentation

##Looking at the Whole Person, Not Just the Whole Portfolio
Earlier in the program you worked on your resume, cover letters, and portfolio. Buildin
List your strengths in your README. Be as open-ended as you like. You can focus on being serious or add humor or take any other approach you like. Relevant experience at a past job could be an example of a serious strength. Being good at walking backwards with your eyes closed might not be something you put on your resume, but feel free to put it in your README.

In addition, make a list of your personal interests, hobbies and so on. Expressing yourself creatively in this way might lead insights about strengths and personal interests that could end up in your resume or portfolio site. These quirky details can also help convey a sense of who you are as a person, which might get a potential employer's attention.

Once you are finished with your lists, pick which strengths and personal interests you'd like to convey in your personal portfolio site. Make these strengths as specific as possible and include concrete examples of how you embody these strengths. Feel free to utilize material from LinkedIn/Cover Letter day if you feel it might be useful. 

#### Here are some examples:

I'm a resilient person that takes on new challenges. (Include a photo from a long backpacking trip or another experience that shows your resilience.)
I have strong problem-solving skills. (Cite an example from a past job or include a code snippet you're proud of.)
How you convey these strengths is ultimately up to you. When you're finished with your project for the day, add a paragraph to your README that describes how you incorporated and highlighted your strengths on your portfolio site.

Note: This prompt is supposed to be fun but you should still take it seriously. If the objective isn't met, you'll have to resubmit.

## Developing Your Portfolio

There are a million different directions you can take your portfolio project. Here are a few options:

Add skills and projects tables to your database; as an admin, you should have the ability to create, read, update and delete skills and projects on your page.
Add a blog with your first blog entry.
Deploy to Heroku.
Add ActionMailer so you can send automated emails if clients try to contact you.
Add amazing styling.
Don't forget to protect routes that only admins should use!
Consider using RailsAdmin or another admin gem to easily add admin functionality to your site.
Explore adding other gems and functionality to your site.
There's more than enough to keep you busy for the day! 

## Ultimately, these are your specific goals:

Build a portfolio site that you're proud to share with family, friends, classmates, potential clients and employers. (If you don't feel your piece is portfolio-ready by the end of the day, don't be discouraged; keep working on this project in your spare time!)

Try to differentiate yourself in some way; what can you add to your project that makes you stand out? What are your key strengths? Once you go out in the real world, you'll need to differentiate yourself from other junior developers and code school graduates that are looking for jobs.
Keep learning! Use your time to build on your understanding of both Ruby and Rails. Remember to add to your README and commit if you spend part of the day focused on your learning experience.
