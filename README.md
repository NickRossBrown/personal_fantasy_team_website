# Self Authentication

###### Epicodus: Ruby Independent Project 08/14/2018
###### By Nicholas Brown

## Description
A project for my self-refection and personal branding. This project is to indirectly help me with my resume, cover letters, and portfolio. Further down in this readme I will write out my self-reflection. Similar to how a piece of art shows a part of the artist who it; the goal this rails project will service to find ways to express part of the life of the creator, me.


## The "big picture"

I always start any personal project the same way, with a book. I tend to find myself running down a rabbit hole where I realize that the contraption I proudly built, which rotates around its center axis and reduces friction, is a wheel. So, with a quick online search I found a book, Strengths Finder 2.0 by Tom Rath, to help me with its overall suggestion of the top five themes/strengths that are associated wit my personality. The book was advertised well, with high star average amazon rating. I didn't read close enough to see that the ebook I was buying was just a collection of 34 strengths/theme's explinations and suggestions, and that I can only take the test, online, ONCE (I wanted to share the test with my classmates). Not sraping the strengthFiner idea for the self assignment project and starting over I'm going to see what the results have to offer me (I'm going frustratingly ignore all the various "spend more money and upgrade for additional results" options listed all over the website). 



#### Adaptability

* Fine-tune my responsiveness, when uncreditable work pressure hits practice the first 3 moves I will make. 
        - One of the most useful responses that I have found helpful over the years is to not say "you" whenever anyone does something that bothers me. Saying 'you' tends to be fighting words by someone on the defense. There is a big difference between saying "You need clean those dirty dishes. They have been left out for days now", than "I get really frustrated and upset when I see dirty dishes that look to be rotting" I found that if I start by declaring "you" my roommate responds himself by also saying "yeah... but you did this" and we got nowhere until I thought about how I respond to uncreditable roommate conflict.

#### Intellection

* Write down ideas in a log. They might provide valuable insights.
        - I love painting, and recently I have been into abstract art. I get that 'I can do that, but better' feeling looking at different abstract paintings. (picture of paintings here) 

#### Restorative
* Constant improvement is one of your hallmarks seek opportunity to enhance my ablilities through a demanding field, activity, or endevavor that requires exceptional skill and/or knowledge. 
        - The brain is a muscle, and I think that it is important to contiuously keep working it out. Whenever I have the free time to study I pick up chess and try to improve my chess skilss. (link uscf website)

#### Empathy
* Create a ritual at the end of the day to signal that work is over. This will help me emotions and prevent burnout. 


#### Relator
* Let it be known I am more interested in the character and personality of others than their status or job title. 
         - I simple will not golf with some people I've met, and they are way better golfers than I am. Someone cannot hide an anger problem on a golf course. People are going to ht frustatingly bad shots when they know they are more than capible of hitting adecent one.
