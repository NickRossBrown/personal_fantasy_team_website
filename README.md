# Self Authentication

###### Epicodus: Ruby Independent Project 08/14/2018
###### By Nicholas Brown

## Description
A project for my self-refection and personal branding. This project is to indirectly help me with my resume, cover letters, and portfolio. Further down in this readme I will write out my self-reflection. Similar to how a piece of art shows a part of the artist who it; the goal this rails project will service to find ways to express part of the life of the creator, me.


## The "big picture"

I always start any personal project the same way, with a book. I tend to find myself running down a rabbit hole where I realize that the contraption I proudly built, which rotates around its center axis and reduces friction, is a wheel. So, with a quick online search I found a book, Strengths Finder 2.0 by Tom Rath, to help me with its overall suggestion of the top five themes/strengths that are associated wit my personality. The book was advertised well, with high star average amazon rating. I didn't read close enough to see that the ebook I was buying was just a collection of 34 strengths/theme's explinations and suggestions, and that I can only take the test, online, ONCE (I wanted to share the test with my classmates).
