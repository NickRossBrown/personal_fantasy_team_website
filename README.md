# Self Authentication

###### Epicodus: Ruby Independent Project 08/14/2018
###### By Nicholas Brown

## Description
A project for my self-refection and personal branding. This project is to indirectly help me with my resume, cover letters, and portfolio. Further down in this readme I will write out my self-reflection. Similar to how a piece of art shows a part of the artist who it; the goal this rails project will service to find ways to express part of the life of the creator, me.


## The "big picture"

I always start any personal project the same way, with a book. I tend to find myself running down a rabbit hole where I realize that the contraption I proudly built, which rotates around its center axis and reduces friction, is a wheel. So, with a quick online search I found a book, Strengths Finder 2.0 by Tom Rath, to help me with its overall suggestion of the top five themes/strengths that are associated wit my personality. The book was advertised well, with high star average amazon rating. I didn't read close enough to see that the ebook I was buying was just a collection of 34 strengths/theme's explinations and suggestions, and that I can only take the test, online, ONCE (I wanted to share the test with my classmates). Not sraping the strengthFiner idea for the self assignment project and starting over I'm going to see what the results have to offer me (I'm going frustratingly ignore all the various "spend more money and upgrade for additional results" options listed all over the website). 



#### Adaptability

* Look for help when planning, people with strong Focus/Stratetic/belief talents to help with the long-term goals. 
   
        -personal note

* Fine-tune my responsiveness, when uncreditable work pressure hits practice the first 3 moves I will make. 

         -personal note

#### Intellection
* Schedule time for thinking, it can be energising for me. 

        -personal note

* Write down ideas in a log. They might provide valuable insights.

        -personal note

* People may think I am aloof or disengaged spending time alone/closing a door. Let them know this is a reflection of my thinking and not a result from a disregard for relationships.

        -personal note

#### Restorative
* Constant improvement is one of your hallmarks seek opportunity to enhance my ablilities through a demanding field, activity, or endevavor that requires exceptional skill and/or knowledge. 

        -personal note


* seek roles in which I am paid to solve problems or in my ability to restore and resolve. 

        -personal note

#### Empathy

* Although my intuitions may feel like hunches, take note of them. 

        -personal note


* Create a ritual at the end of the day to signal that work is over. This will help me emotions and prevent burnout. 

        -personal note


#### Relator

* Fnd a workplace in which friendships are encourages. I will not do well in overly formal organizations. In job interviews, ask about work styles and work culture. 

        -personal note

* Let it be known I am more interested in the character and personality of others than their status or job title. 

        -personal note
